# Design Decisions
+ used links to html pages that resembled buttons to make transitioning
between pages easier.
+ used white, grey, and black for a minimalistic look
+ used san serif font for buttons and serif for other text
+ mark an item as completed by selecting the checkbox next
+ show all items at all times
  + don't let editing create a dialog box and hides other items

# Challenges
+ not understanding the specifications - how the tasks related to each other
  + attended office hours and received clarification about assignment
  + determined that task is to create a series of html pages that show
the specified tasks being executed
+ Chrome mobile view displays elements with abnormally small size, but
other browsers are unaffected

# Design Highlights
+ disguising links as buttons that link to the next page
+ allowed users to complete the tasks successfully and continuously,
without going back to index
