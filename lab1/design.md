figure out how to change form/list without javascript code. 
tried using a form with checkboxes and text inputs as labels. 
tried changing label color on checking box to resemble deletion. 
added button for creating new items (non-functional). 
added some css to modify text size and font. 
challenges: modifying items and deleting completed items.

received clarification about assignment during office hours, 
determined task is to create a series of html pages that show
the specified tasks being executed

16 Sept
design decisions: used flexbox for list items for better alignment
and gridbox for list buttons to align with list items. 
used links to html pages that resembled buttons to make transitioning
between pages easier. 
used white, grey, and black for a minimalistic look. 
used san serif font for buttons and serif for other text. 

created html pages with lists and links to transition between them
decided order of tasks. 
1. task 1: add item "Buy new John Grisham book"

user testing: tested by us, going through tasks sequentially, no
problems found. 
the design we were most proud of was disguising links as buttons that
