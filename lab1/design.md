figure out how to change form/list without javascript code
tried using a form with checkboxes and text inputs as labels
tried changing label color on checking box to resemble deletion
added button for creating new items (non-functional)
added some css to modify text size and font
challenges: modifying items and deleting completed items

13 Sept
received clarification about assignment during office hours, 
determined task is to create a series of html pages that show
the specified tasks being executed

16 Sept
created html pages with lists and links to transition between them
decided order of tasks
task 1: add item "Buy new John Grisham book"
task 2: add item "Eat lunch"
task 3: add item "Call Mom" and mark item "Call Mom" completed
task 4: add item "Text John" and edit to "Text John about bank statements"
task 5: show uncompleted tasks
task 6: delete completed tasks





user testing: tested by us, going through tasks sequentially, no
problems found
the design we were most proud of was disguising links as buttons that
link to the next page
